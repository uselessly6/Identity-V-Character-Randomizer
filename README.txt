This is a basic script in python for a random IDV character selector.
Here is how to run/use the code.
1. Using your python running software press "run" (you can use open-python.com)
2. The script will ask you to choose a faction, either Hunter or Survivor (case insensitive)
3. Write your choice and press enter.
4. The script will give you a random character from that faction.

That's all. Suggestions are welcome, this script is very basic and I am very very new to coding. Thank you!
